Hello! I am a MSc student at the University of Toronto advised by Prof. Alec Jacobson. My research interests are in Computer Vision and 3D Geometry. Currently, my research focuses on robust Gaussian Splatting reconstructions. Previously, I have worked with Prof. Igor Gilitschenski on dexterous robot grasping, and Dr. Qin Liu and Prof. Greg Evans on research in engineering education.
