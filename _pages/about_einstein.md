Hello! I am a 4th year Engineering Science (Machine Intelligence specialization) student at University of Toronto. My research interests are in computer vision, 3D geometries and robotics. I am currently working with by Prof. Igor Gilitschenski and Maria Attarian on dexterous robot grasping. Previously, I also did research in Engineering Education, supervised by Dr. Qin Liu and Prof. Greg Evans.

I am applying for research-based Masters programs in Canada and US for Fall 2025 entry!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
